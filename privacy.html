        <br>
        <h4>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</h4>
        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a 
            privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the 
            United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable 
            information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly 
            the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with 
            this policy. <br><br>
            According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
            </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Users can visit our site anonymously;</li>
            <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our 
                website;</li>
            <li>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;</li>
            <li>Users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at <b>support@vijanatech.com</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals: <br><br>
            We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track 
            browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform 
            websites that you do not want to be tracked. <br><br>
            You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h4>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your 
            data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and 
            ask us:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to you:</b>

                    <li>A list of categories of personal information that we have sold, along with the category of any other

            Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you 
            may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your 
            personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising

            obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
