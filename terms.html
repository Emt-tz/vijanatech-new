        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Welcome to <b>Vijana Tech</b> (“us”, “we”, or “our”)!

            These Terms of Service (“Terms”, “Terms of Service”) govern your use of our website located at 
            <b>vijanatech.com</b> (together or individually “Service”) operated by <b>Vijana Tech</b>. <br><br>
            Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect, safeguard and disclose 
            information that results from your use of our web pages. <br><br>
            Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy (“Agreements”). You acknowledge that you 
            have read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound of them. <br><br>
            If you do not agree with (or cannot comply with) Agreements, then you may not use the Service, but please 
            let us know by emailing at <b>support@vijanatech</b>.com so we can try to find a solution. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use Service.
            
            <br>
        <h4>Communications</h4>
        <p>By using our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, 
            of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or by emailing at support@vijanatech.com.</p>

          <br>

          <h4>Purchases</h4>
          <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through Service (“Purchase”), you may be asked to 
              supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including but not limited to, your credit or debit card 
              number, the expiration date of your card, your billing address, and your shipping information. <br><br>
            You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any card(s) or other payment method(s) in 
            connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete. <br><br>
            We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of 
            Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third 
            parties subject to our Privacy Policy. <br><br>
            We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product 
            or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or 
            other reasons. <br><br>
            We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.
            </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</h4>
          <p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) made available through Service 
              may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms of Service. If you participate in any 
              Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a 
              Promotion conflict with these Terms of Service, Promotion rules will apply.</p>

              <br>

          <h4>Subscriptions</h4>
          <p>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance 
              on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles will be set depending on the type of 
              subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. <br><br>
            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions 
            unless you cancel it or Vijana Tech cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through 
            your online account management page or by contacting support@vijanatech.com customer support team. <br><br>
            A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Vijana 
            Tech with accurate and complete billing information that may include but not limited to full name, address, 
            state, postal or zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such 
            payment information, you automatically authorize Vijana Tech to charge all Subscription fees incurred 
            through your account to any such payment instruments. <br><br>
            Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Vijana Tech reserves the right to terminate your 
            access to the Service with immediate effect.
            </p>
          
          <br>
          <h4>Free Trial</h4>
          <p>Vijana Tech may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of 
              time ("Free Trial"). <br><br>
            You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial. <br><br>
            If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by Vijana 
            Tech until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your 
            Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of 
            Subscription you have selected. <br><br>
            At any time and without notice, Vijana Tech reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial 
            offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
            
            </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Fee Changes</h4>
        <p>Vijana Tech, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. 
            Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. <br><br>
            Vijana Tech will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you 
            an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. <br><br>
            Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement 
            to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
            
            </p>

        <h4>Limitation Of Liability</h4>
        <p>EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU WILL HOLD US AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS HARMLESS FOR ANY INDIRECT, 
            PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, HOWEVER IT ARISES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND ALL RELATED COSTS 
            AND EXPENSES OF LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION, OR AT TRIAL OR ON APPEAL, IF ANY, WHETHER OR NOT LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION IS 
            INSTITUTED), WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH 
            THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY CLAIM FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT AND 
            ANY VIOLATION BY YOU OF ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL LAWS, STATUTES, RULES, OR REGULATIONS, EVEN IF COMPANY HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY 
            ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, IF THERE IS LIABILITY FOUND ON THE PART OF COMPANY, IT 
            WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THERE BE CONSEQUENTIAL OR 
            PUNITIVE DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE 
            PRIOR LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Termination</h4>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole 
            discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of Terms.
            If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service. <br><br>
            All provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without 
            limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
            </p>
            <br>
        <h4>Governing Law</h4>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Tanzania, which governing law applies to agreement 
            without regard to its conflict of law provisions. <br><br>
            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision 
            of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. 
            These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we 
            might have had between us regarding Service.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Changes To Service</h4>
        <p>We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion 
            without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. 
            From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered users.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Amendments To Terms</h4>
        <p>We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is your responsibility to review these 
            Terms periodically. <br><br>
            Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are 
            expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. <br><br>
            By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. 
            If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Waiver And Severability</h4>
        <p>No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or 
            condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall 
            not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. <br><br>
            If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable 
            for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms 
            will continue in full force and effect.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Acknowledgement</h4>
